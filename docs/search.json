These data contain information on baby names, sex, year of birth, and number of occurrences of each name in a given year. This research will explore the most popular baby names in the dataset by year and generation, how the proportion of babies with the most popular names has changed over time, and whether baby name popularity is cyclical in nature. Finally, this research will consider if and how the answers to these questions differ by sex."

    "text": "Background\nCompared to decisions regarding sleep, breastfeeding, schools and more, naming your baby may seem like one of the more arbitrary and inconsequential choices a parent makes. But it is a deeply personal decision, laden with expectations, hopes, and even whimsy. Baby names may seem like an innocuous, fluffy data point, but they provide a fascinating window into the cultural trends and societal values of the United States at different points in time.\nMy interest in baby names and naming trends in the United States is personally motivated. The day we found out I was pregnant back in spring 2020 my husband suggested the name Oliver if we had a boy. I loved it, but found out soon enough that we weren’t the only ones. In 2020, Oliver was the third most popular name given to baby boys in the United States.\nI thought back to my childhood in rural Vermont, where four out of the 16 kids in my class in elementary school were named Chris. I did not want my son to be one of four Olivers in a classroom. While we tried to find alternative names, a friend suggested that while Oliver is a popular name now (as Chris was in the mid 1980s) the actual percentage of babies named Oliver is likely less, since the diversity of names has increased in recent times. When I found this baby names data I knew I had to investigate this hypothesis.\nIn addition to answering this burning question, I will explore other patterns around name popularity, including which names have been the most popular during different time periods, and whether there is a cyclical nature to popularity for some names."

    "section": "Dataset Introduction",
    "text": "Dataset Introduction\nThe data I’ll be analyzing was downloaded from the Social Security Administration (SSA) website. It is all of the names in the SSA database, which are drawn from Social Security card applications for babies born in the United States from 1880 until 2021. This analysis goes beyond what is featured on the SSA website, which is limited to just the top 1,000 names for each year and sex. The data that will be used in this analysis includes all names between 1880 and 2021 with some stipulations (see below).\nSome additional notes about this data:\n\nThe SSA states that before 1937 many people did not apply for a Social Security card, and so their names will not be reflected in the data.\nRecords that did not include the state of birth, sex, and year of birth are not included in the data.\nIn order to be included, names had to be at least 2 characters long.\nIn order to protect the privacy of individuals, the SSA restricts this list to only names with at least 5 occurrences. They state in their accompanying documentation: “If a name has less than 5 occurrences for a year of birth in any state, the sum of the state counts for that year will be less than the national count.”\nBecause name data are not edited, there may be mistakes in the sex listed and entries such as “Unknown” and “Baby” have not been removed. In fact, there are 591 occurrences of “Baby” and 760 occurrences of “Unknown” listed as baby names in this data. Since these are not actual names, we will remove these during the data cleaning section below.\nThe SSA did not combine similar names with different spelling. So names Caitlin, Caitlyn, Kaitlin, Kaitlyn, and other version are all listed separately. This should be considered a limitation since it may obscure the true popularity of names that can be spelled in different ways, such as Caitlin.\n\n\nLoad the data\nThis data was stored in 142 text files (one for each year the data was collected), which is read into R by following several steps. First, I created an list object with all of the text files, then a function that read in the data, provided column names, and added a new variable that tracked the year. Finally, the map_dfr() function was used to apply the new function to the file list object and to bind everything together into one dataset.\n\n\nCode\n# Create filenames object with all babynames text files\nfilenames &lt;- list.files(\"~/601_Spring_2023/601_Spring_2023/posts/JustineShakespeare_FinalProjectData/names\", pattern=\"*.txt\")\n\n# create function to read in the files and create Year variable with year pulled from filename\nread_babynames&lt;-function(path=\"~/601_Spring_2023/601_Spring_2023/posts/JustineShakespeare_FinalProjectData/names\", fn){\n  read_csv(paste(path, fn, sep=\"/\"), \n           col_names = c(\"Name\", \"Sex\", \"Occurrences\"))%&gt;%\n    mutate(Year = parse_number(fn))\n}\n\n# bind all together while reading it in by passing list of files through the function\nBabyNames&lt;- map_dfr(filenames, ~read_babynames(fn=.x))\n\n\n\n\nData Description\nNow that the data is loaded, let’s take a closer look.\n\n\nCode\nglimpse(BabyNames)\n\n\nRows: 2,052,781\nColumns: 4\n$ Name        &lt;chr&gt; \"Mary\", \"Anna\", \"Emma\", \"Elizabeth\", \"Minnie\", \"Margaret\",…\n$ Sex         &lt;chr&gt; \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\"…\n$ Occurrences &lt;dbl&gt; 7065, 2604, 2003, 1939, 1746, 1578, 1472, 1414, 1320, 1288…\n$ Year        &lt;dbl&gt; 1880, 1880, 1880, 1880, 1880, 1880, 1880, 1880, 1880, 1880…\n\n\nEach case in this data represents a name given to a baby and the number of babies with that name in a given year and sex. This data includes all of the names reported to the Social Security Administration (with some exceptions, see notes above), totaling well over 100,000 unique names across 142 years (from 1880 to 2021). Most names are repeated in many years and so the dataset has well over 2 million observations.\nWe will use all of the variables in this data frame, which are: Name, Year, Sex, and Occurrences. There are no NAs in this data so we do not have to decide how to handle them. While the data is already pretty tidy, there are a few small changes we can make to make this data easier to use. First we’ll recode the values of the Sex variable so that “F” and “M” are spelled out. As noted in the introduction, there are some cases of “Baby” and “Unknown” in this data that are not actual names. We will remove those.\n\n\nCode\n# recode values in the Sex variable\nBabyNames &lt;- BabyNames %&gt;% \n  mutate(Sex = recode(Sex, \"F\" = \"Female\", \"M\" = \"Male\"))\n\n# remove all instances of \"Baby\" and \"Unknown\"\nBabyNames &lt;- BabyNames %&gt;% \n  filter(Name != \"Baby\" & Name != \"Unknown\")\n\n\nThis brings the total observations in the data from 2,052,781 to 2,052,337.\nNow let’s take a closer look at the data. We can use the filter() and n_distinct() functions to see how many unique names there are in the data, by sex and in total.\n\n\nCode\n# find unique number of female names in the data\nFemaleNames &lt;- filter(BabyNames, Sex == \"Female\") \nTotFemNames &lt;- n_distinct(FemaleNames$Name)\ncat(\"Total unique female names in the data: \", TotFemNames)\n\n\nTotal unique female names in the data:  69525\n\n\nCode\n# find unique number of male names in the data\nMaleNames &lt;- filter(BabyNames, Sex == \"Male\")\nTotMaleNames &lt;- n_distinct(MaleNames$Name)\ncat(\"Total unique male names in the data: \", TotMaleNames)\n\n\nTotal unique male names in the data:  43091\n\n\nCode\n# find total unique number of names in the data\ncat(\"Total unique names in the data: \", TotFemNames+TotMaleNames)\n\n\nTotal unique names in the data:  112616\n\n\nThere are much fewer unique names for males than there are for females in this data. Note this is not counting occurrences of names, but unique names.\nSince Occurrences is our numeric variable, let’s take a look at a statistical summary of this data. As a reminder, the Occurrences variable is the number of times a baby is given a specific name in a single year.\n\n\nCode\n# take a look at summary statistics for the Occurrences variable\nBabyNames %&gt;%\n  summarize(Min = min(Occurrences),\n            Mean = mean(Occurrences),\n            Median = median(Occurrences),\n            Max = max(Occurrences))\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThese descriptive statistics show how many times a name was given to a baby by sex in a single year, so the max represents a name that was given to 99,693 babies in a single year for either male or female babies. Without information on the year, it’s hard to get a sense of what these numbers are telling us. I ran this analysis with the Year variable included, so that it provided these statistics for each year in the data. For the purposes of this analysis I’ll include below a version of this table that includes these statistics by decade.\n\n\nCode\n# create a decade variable that allows us to group the data by decade\nBabyNames &lt;- BabyNames %&gt;%\n  mutate(Decade = cut(Year, breaks = seq(1879, 2030, by = 10), labels = format(seq(1880, 2020, by = 10), format = \"%Y\")))\n\n# look at summary statistics of the Occurrences variables by decade\nBabyNames %&gt;%\n  group_by(Decade) %&gt;% \n  summarize(Min = min(Occurrences),\n            Mean = mean(Occurrences),\n            Median = median(Occurrences),\n            Max = max(Occurrences))\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis table shows the minimum, mean, median, and maximum number of occurrences of a name, by sex, and for an individual year averaged across the decade. The minimum makes sense given the note shared by the SSA that stated that no name with fewer than 5 occurrences was included in the data. The mean indicates that the average baby shares their name with that many other babies of the same sex born the same year. It looks as if the time when babies shared their names with the most other children on average was in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s. In all decades the median is much lower than the mean, which indicates that popular names that are given to many children skew the distribution of Occurrences. The median indicates the midpoint, which means that half of the names in the data are given to fewer than 11, 12, or 13 (depending on the year) babies each year. The max indicates the number of occurrences of the most popular name of the year. The specific names that constitute the maximum each year will be explored in more detail in the Analysis section."

    "text": "Analysis Plan\n\nResearch Questions\n\nWhat are the most popular names in a given year? What are the most popular names in the entire dataset across all years? Finally, what were the most popular names for each generation?\nHas there been a change over time in the proportion of babies who are named the most popular names? More specifically, is the name Oliver as popular now in the 2020s as Christopher was in the 1980s?\nIs there a cyclical nature to the popularity of some names? Are there some names that were popular in earlier generations that have regained popularity recently?\n\n\n\nAdditional Variables\nThe analysis and visualization that I will do for this project will be driven by my research questions. I’ll need to create several additional variables in order to answer the research questions, including:\n\nSum_Occurrences - this variable will constitute different sums depending on the goal of the analysis at hand and it will enable summing individual name occurrences across years and generations. (research questions 1 and 2).\nTotal_Year_Occurrences - this variable will sum the total occurrences of all names across a single year. It will be used to create the proportion variable (research question 2).\nGeneration - this variable will indicate the generation to which each year belongs. It will be used to perform analysis exploring the most popular names in a generation (research question 1).\nGeneration_Rank - this variable will rank names based on the number of occurrences within a generation. This will be used in the analysis exploring the most popular names in a generation (research question 1).\nYear_Rank - this variable will rank names based on the number of occurrences within a year. It will be used in the analysis exploring both the change in proportion of popular names and the cyclical nature of popular names (research questions 2 and 3).\nProportion - this variable is is created by dividing the sum of occurrences for one name in a given year by the total occurrences of all names in the same year. This will be used for analysis exploring how the proportion of popular names has changed over time (research question 2).\n\n\n\nVisualizations\nEach research question will include a set of data visualizations that illustrate the patterns discovered by this analysis.\n\nResearch Question 1: What are the most popular names across a variety of categories (year, all time, generation)?\nFor this question I will use piping, group_by(), summarize() and other functions to pull the top names in a given year by sex; across all years (from 1880 to 2021) by sex; and in each generation by sex. For the top 10 names across all years I will show the names in two lollipop charts, one for each sex, that visualize each name and their total occurrences throughout the entire dataset. For the analysis of the most popular names in a generation, I will create two new variables identifying which Generation a year falls into and the rank of each name within each generation (Generation_Rank). For this analysis I will create a table and a stacked bar graph that will show the top five names for each sex in each generation.\n\n\nResearch Question 2: Has there been a change over time in the proportion of babies who are named the top ranking names? (specifically, Christopher and Oliver?)\nFor this question I will use piping, group_by(), summarize(), mutate() and other functions to create two new variables: Year_Rank and Proportion. These new variables will capture the ranking of each name in each year and the proportion of babies that have each name in a given year. I will create a data visualization that charts the top 3 ranked names across time by proportion so that we can see whether the proportion of babies with the top ranked names changes over time. Finally, to answer the specific question regarding Christopher vs Oliver, I’ll create a set of time series graphs that show the the change in popularity of both names according to occurrences, ranking, and proportion over time.\n\n\nResearch Question 3: Is there a cyclical nature to the popularity of some names?\nFor this question I will select an individual year in the data and use filter(), full_join() and other functions to compare the top 100 baby names of that year with the top 100 baby names from a year exactly 100 years earlier to determine if there are names that fall on both lists. Then I will graph the names that appear on both lists to examine the popularity ranking of those names throughout the intervening years. I’ll perform this analysis with two sets of years in order to determine whether the same trend is observed in two different time periods."

    "text": "Analysis and Visualizations\n\nResearch Question 1Research Question 2Research Question 3\n\n\nThis question has three parts:\na. What are the most popular names in a given year, by sex?\nb. What are the most popular names across the entire timeframe covered in the data (1880-2021), by sex?\nc. What are the most popular names for each generation in the data (as defined by several external sources)\nThese questions will allow us to get an overview of baby name popularity in the United States and from there we can investigate specific patterns explored in research questions 2 and 3.\n\nMost popular names in a given year\nFirst let’s explore the most popular names in a given year and sex (question 1.a).\n\n\nCode\n# Most popular name in a year, female\nPopF_Year &lt;- BabyNames %&gt;% \n  filter(Sex == \"Female\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year, Name) %&gt;% \n  summarize(\"Sum_Occurrences\" = sum(Occurrences)) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(Sum_Occurrences)) %&gt;% \n  rename(\"Total Occurrences\" = Sum_Occurrences) %&gt;% \n  head(n = 10)\n\n# format kable table\nkable(PopF_Year, format = \"html\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling() %&gt;%\n  column_spec(2, bold = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  row_spec(1:10, color = \"#F27059\") %&gt;%\n  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = \"#EFEFF0\", \n           background = \"#F27059\") %&gt;%\n  row_spec(1:10, background = \"#FFFCF9\")\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nName\nTotal Occurrences\n\n\n\n\n1947\nLinda\n99693\n\n\n1948\nLinda\n96212\n\n\n1949\nLinda\n91019\n\n\n1950\nLinda\n80431\n\n\n1921\nMary\n73985\n\n\n1951\nLinda\n73977\n\n\n1924\nMary\n73535\n\n\n1922\nMary\n72177\n\n\n1947\nMary\n71684\n\n\n1923\nMary\n71635\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year when the most female babies were given the same name was in 1947, when 99,693 babies were named Linda. The next three most popular names in a year were Linda again in the three years that following 1947. Mary makes up most of the second half of the list, primarily in the 1920s. The years here, including the fact that 1947 shows up twice on this short list, likely reflect the high number of babies born during the Baby Boom. Given that there were fewer babies in the 1920s, seeing Mary on this list during that time period reflects the huge popularity of that name. This data also reflects the trend of popular names remaining popular for at least a few years in a row.\n\n\nCode\n# Most popular name in a year, male\nPopM_Year &lt;- BabyNames %&gt;% \n  filter(Sex == \"Male\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year, Name) %&gt;% \n  summarize(\"Sum_Occurrences\" = sum(Occurrences)) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(Sum_Occurrences)) %&gt;% \n  rename(\"Total Occurrences\" = Sum_Occurrences) %&gt;% \n  head(n = 10)\n\n# format kable table\nkable(PopM_Year, format = \"html\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling() %&gt;%\n  column_spec(2, bold = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  row_spec(1:10, color = \"#2A9D8F\") %&gt;%\n  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = \"#EFEFF0\", \n           background = \"#2A9D8F\") %&gt;%\n  row_spec(1:10, background = \"#FFFCF9\")\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nName\nTotal Occurrences\n\n\n\n\n1947\nJames\n94762\n\n\n1957\nMichael\n92723\n\n\n1947\nRobert\n91651\n\n\n1956\nMichael\n90715\n\n\n1958\nMichael\n90574\n\n\n1948\nJames\n88595\n\n\n1954\nMichael\n88570\n\n\n1955\nMichael\n88353\n\n\n1947\nJohn\n88321\n\n\n1946\nJames\n87440\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the male names, James had the highest number of occurrences in 1947. The male list is dominated by the names James, Michael, Robert, and John, primarily from the late 1940s and 1950s. Again, this data reflects the high number of babies during the Baby Boom and the pattern of popular names remaining popular for several years in a row.\n\n\nMost popular names across all years\nLet’s look at the names that have been the most popular in the United States across all years in the data (question 1.b). Starting with female names, we’ll use a lollipop graph that allows us to compare the total occurrences of each name.\n\n\nCode\n# lollipop graph of the most popular female names in the dataset\nBabyNames %&gt;% \n  filter(Sex == \"Female\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Name) %&gt;% \n  summarize(\"Sum_Occurrences\" = sum(Occurrences)) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(Sum_Occurrences)) %&gt;% \n  slice(1:10) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_rev(fct_reorder(Name, Sum_Occurrences)), y = Sum_Occurrences)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4, color = \"#F27059\", \n             fill=alpha(\"#F4845F\", 0.7), \n             alpha = 0.9, shape = 21, stroke=2) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x=fct_rev(fct_reorder(Name, Sum_Occurrences)), xend=fct_rev(fct_reorder(Name, Sum_Occurrences)), y=0, yend=Sum_Occurrences), \n               linewidth=2.5, color=\"#F4845F\", linetype=\"solid\")  +\n  labs(title = \"Top Ten Female Names in the United States 1880-2021\",\n       x = \"Name\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.55)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) { paste0(x / 1000000, \" mil\")})\n\n\n\n\n\nMary is the most popular female name, with 4,132,497 baby girls with that name between 1880 and 2021. There are well over more than twice as many female babies with the name Mary than any other female name. The next most popular names are Elizabeth, Patricia, and Jennifer. Even though Linda was in our top ten lists of most occurrences in a year, Linda is only the 5th most popular name of all female baby names. This indicates that while Linda was the most popular during specific moments in time, it did not have the same long-lasting, enduring popularity of the names higher on this list.\n\n\nCode\n# lollipop graph of the most popular male names in the dataset\nBabyNames %&gt;% \n  filter(Sex == \"Male\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Name) %&gt;% \n  summarize(\"Sum_Occurrences\" = sum(Occurrences)) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(Sum_Occurrences)) %&gt;% \n  slice(1:10) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_rev(fct_reorder(Name, Sum_Occurrences)), y = Sum_Occurrences)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4, color = \"#228176\", \n             fill=alpha(\"#2A9D8F\", 0.7),\n             alpha = 0.9, shape = 21, stroke=2) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x=fct_rev(fct_reorder(Name, Sum_Occurrences)), xend=fct_rev(fct_reorder(Name, Sum_Occurrences)), y=0, yend=Sum_Occurrences), \n               linewidth=2.5, color=\"#2A9D8F\", linetype=\"solid\")  +\n  labs(title = \"Top Ten Male Names in the United States 1880-2021\",\n       x = \"Name\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.55)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) { paste0(x / 1000000, \" mil\")})\n\n\n\n\n\nJames is the most popular male name, with 5,202,714 baby boys named James from 1880 to 2021. Unlike the list of female names, the top male names all have fairly similar levels of total occurrences. James is followed closely by John, Robert, and Michael.\n\n\nMost popular names in each generation\nLet’s turn to the last part of research question 1 and look at the most popular names of each generation.\nFirst, we’ll create a new Generations variable that indicates in which generation a year falls. The years defining each generation are primarily drawn from the Pew Research Center.1 The earliest generation, the Lost Generation, was not covered in Pew and so was drawn from another source.2 This source defined the Lost Generation as starting in 1883, but for the purposes of this analysis, we will also include babies named in 1880 through 1882 in the Lost Generation so that those years are included in the analysis.\n\n\nCode\n# define the generation variable\nBabyNames_gen &lt;- BabyNames %&gt;% \n  mutate(\"Generation\" = case_when(\n    Year &lt;= 1900 ~ \"1.

Generation Alpha\"))\n\n\nNow that we have created our Generation variable, let’s take a look at the top five names (of each sex) for each generation.\n\nCode\n# find the total number of occurrences for each generation\nBabyNames_gen %&gt;% \n  group_by(Generation) %&gt;% \n  summarize(sum_by_gen = sum(Occurrences)) %&gt;% \n  arrange(sum_by_gen)\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\n# creating a ranking per generation\nGeneration_rank &lt;- BabyNames_gen %&gt;% \n  group_by(Generation, Sex, Name) %&gt;% \n  summarize(SumGen_Occurrences = sum(Occurrences)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Gen_Rank = min_rank(desc(SumGen_Occurrences)))\n\n# in order to create a table that is easy to quickly peruse, we'll do some additional data transformation\n# Separating out the female names and pulling the top five per generation\nBigTable_F &lt;- Generation_rank %&gt;%\n  filter(Sex == \"Female\") %&gt;% \n  group_by(Sex, Generation) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Gen_Rank, Generation) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:5) %&gt;% \n  select(\"Generation\", \"Gen_Rank\", \"Sex\", \"Name\") %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"Gen_Rank\", \n              values_from = \"Name\") %&gt;% \n  rename(\"Rank 1\" = \"1\", \"Rank 2\" = \"2\", \"Rank 3\" = \"3\",\n         \"Rank 4\" = \"4\", \"Rank 5\" = \"5\")\n\n# Separating out the male names and pulling the top five per generation\nBigTable_M &lt;- Generation_rank %&gt;%\n  filter(Sex == \"Male\") %&gt;% \n  group_by(Sex, Generation) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Gen_Rank, Generation) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:5) %&gt;% \n  select(\"Generation\", \"Gen_Rank\", \"Sex\", \"Name\") %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"Gen_Rank\", \n              values_from = \"Name\") %&gt;% \n  rename(\"Rank 1\" = \"1\", \"Rank 2\" = \"2\", \"Rank 3\" = \"3\",\n         \"Rank 4\" = \"4\", \"Rank 5\" = \"5\")\n\n# joining the female and male top five names per generation tables\nBigTable &lt;- bind_rows(BigTable_F, BigTable_M)\n\n# arrange by generation\nBigTable &lt;- arrange(BigTable, Generation)\n\n# final table with design \nkable(BigTable, format = \"html\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling() %&gt;%\n  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = \"#EFEFF0\", \n           background = \"#4357AD\") %&gt;%\n  row_spec(1, color = \"#F27059\", background = \"#FFFCF9\") %&gt;% \n  row_spec(2, color = \"#2A9D8F\", background = \"#FFFCF9\") %&gt;% \n  row_spec(3, color = \"#F27059\", background = \"#EFEFF0\") %&gt;% \n  row_spec(4, color = \"#2A9D8F\", background = \"#EFEFF0\") %&gt;% \n  row_spec(5, color = \"#F27059\", background = \"#FFFCF9\") %&gt;% \n  row_spec(6, color = \"#2A9D8F\", background = \"#FFFCF9\") %&gt;% \n  row_spec(7, color = \"#F27059\", background = \"#EFEFF0\") %&gt;% \n  row_spec(8, color = \"#2A9D8F\", background = \"#EFEFF0\") %&gt;%\n  row_spec(9, color = \"#F27059\", background = \"#FFFCF9\") %&gt;% \n  row_spec(10, color = \"#2A9D8F\", background = \"#FFFCF9\") %&gt;% \n  row_spec(11, color = \"#F27059\", background = \"#EFEFF0\") %&gt;% \n  row_spec(12, color = \"#2A9D8F\", background = \"#EFEFF0\") %&gt;% \n  row_spec(13, color = \"#F27059\", background = \"#FFFCF9\") %&gt;% \n  row_spec(14, color = \"#2A9D8F\", background = \"#FFFCF9\") %&gt;% \n  row_spec(15, color = \"#F27059\", background = \"#EFEFF0\") %&gt;% \n  row_spec(16, color = \"#2A9D8F\", background = \"#EFEFF0\") %&gt;% \n  column_spec(1, color = \"#4357AD\", bold = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration\nSex\nRank 1\nRank 2\nRank 3\nRank 4\nRank 5\n\n\n\n\n1.

It shows that males names are much more concentrated, with James and Jon dominating the top five boys names for the first five generations - a span of 100 years. William is in the top five for the first three generations (only to reappear in the most recent generation Alpha), and Robert appears in five consecutive generations, from the Silent Generation to Generation X. Even when things begin to shift with the Millennial Generation (the first generation without John, James, Robert, or William in the top five) there is still overlap with the previous generation (Michael and David appear in both). Almost all generations have at least two male names on their list that overlap with the top five names of the previous generation. Only Generation Alpha bucks this trend with a list of top five names that have no overlap with the previous generation. Interestingly, while all of the top five names of Generation Alpha are different from Generation Z, we see the re-emergence of James and William, which both dominated the top five names in earlier generations.\nThis trend of the concentration of popular names is not as prominent among the names given to female babies. Of the 30 female names that appear in the top 5 for each generation, only Mary and Emma appear in more than two generations (Mary appears four times, Emma three times). Only five additional names, Barbara, Patricia, Jennifer, Margaret, and Olivia, appear in even two generations. The rest of the names only show up in the top 5 names of just one generation. In fact, for both Generation X and Generation Z, the top five names are entirely different from the generation preceding them.\nThe trends that we see here - the concentration of male names, the long lasting popularity of male names, and the variability within female names - will be further explored in research questions 2 and 3.\n\n\nData visualization of the top ranked names in each generation\nThe following bar graphs show the top 5 male and female names for each generation. The height of the columns represents the sum of occurrences of all five names, the different colors show the distinction between each name.\n\n\nCode\n# set color vector\ncolor_v1 &lt;- c(\"#406DB5\", \"#E84855\", \"#A09FD0\", \"#28AFB0\", \"#FCCA46\")\n\n# visualization with top names in each generation, comparing occurrences by sex\nGeneration_rank %&gt;%\n  group_by(Generation, Sex) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Gen_Rank, Generation) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:5) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = Sex, y = SumGen_Occurrences, fill = as.factor(Gen_Rank), position=\"dodge\")) + \n  geom_col() + facet_wrap(~ Generation, scales=\"free\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) { paste0(x / 1000000, \" mil\")}) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = color_v1) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = Name), size = 3, color = \"#1C1018\", position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +\n  labs(title = \"Top 5 Names of Each Generation by Sex\", \n       x = \"\", y = \"Total Occurrences\", \n       fill = \"Generation Rank\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visual provides a graphic representation of the most popular names of each generation and the number of babies with those names. Note that the scales here, specifically the y-axis, are set to free, and so they vary depending on the values of the data within each plot. We should be careful about drawing conclusions from this visual, since generations are not standard in their length or in the population size they represent. Still, these bar graphs hint at some of the trends we will explore in the next two research questions with a more systematic approach.\nDespite the fact that the population of the United States has grown throughout the years, this data shows that the number of babies with the most popular names has decreased over time. This suggests that popular names were given to more babies in earlier generations than in more recent ones. Research question 2 will investigate this trend in the data.\nThis visualization also hints at whether name popularity follows a consistent or cyclical pattern. As noted above, there are many names (especially male names), that remain in the top five across several generations, reflecting a consistent popularity over the years. In addition, some names drop out of the top five (such as Emma for female names and William for male names) and reappear much later generations. The reappearance of “vintage baby names” will be explored further in research question 3.\nA final noticeable takeaway from this visualization is the difference between sexes. In almost all generations there are more occurrences of the most popular male names, suggesting that there is a higher concentration of males with the same popular name when compared with females. The way in which trends manifest differently by sex will be discussed in both research questions 2 and 3.\n\n\n\nThis question has two parts:\na. Has there been a change over time in the proportion of babies who are named the most popular names?\nb. Specifically, is the name Oliver as popular now in the 2020s, as Christopher was in the 1980s?\nIn an article in the Atlantic, Philip Cohen notes the decline of the popularity of the name Mary and other traditional names in recent years.3 He explains “the modernization theory of name trends,” which essentially states that individualism is playing an increasingly large role in name preferences. I suspect that one way in which this individualism has manifested is that fewer babies are named the same name - in other words, the proportion of babies with popular names has decreased. Let’s see if the data supports this hypothesis.\nIn order to explore this research question, I will create two additional variables. The first will represent the rank of a name in a given year and sex and will be called Year_Rank. The second variable will represent the proportion of babies that have each name in a given year and sex and will be called Proportion.\nThe Year_Rank variable is created by using the group_by(), summarize(), mutate(), and min_rank() functions.\n\n\nCode\n# Creates two new variables, Sum_Occurrences and Year_Rank. \nBabyNames_rank &lt;- BabyNames %&gt;% \n  group_by(Year, Sex, Name) %&gt;% \n  summarize(\"Sum_Occurrences\" = sum(Occurrences)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Year_Rank = min_rank(desc(Sum_Occurrences)))\n\n\nThe Proportion variable is created using the group_by(), mutate() and sum() functions and dividing the total occurrences of a name in a given year by the total occurrences of all names in that year.\n\n\nCode\n# create the Proportion variable\nBabyNames_prop &lt;- BabyNames_rank %&gt;% \n  group_by(Year, Sex) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Year_Total_Occurrences = sum(Sum_Occurrences)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Proportion = Sum_Occurrences/Year_Total_Occurrences)\n\n\n\nData visualization of the top ranked names\nThis graph shows the top three ranked names in a year, and the proportion of babies with that name. Note that each line does not represent a specific name, but rather one of the top three ranked names for the given year.\n\n\nCode\n# graph of top three names for each year by sex\ncolor_prop &lt;-  c(\"#F0544F\", \"goldenrod1\", \"cornflowerblue\")\nBabyNames_prop %&gt;% \n  filter(Year_Rank &lt;= 3) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Year, Proportion, group = as.factor(Year_Rank), \n             colour = as.factor(Year_Rank))) +  \n  geom_line() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = color_prop) +\n  geom_smooth(linetype = \"11\", se = FALSE, alpha = 0.7, size = .75) +\n  labs(title = \"Proportion of Top Three Names Each Year, by Sex\", \n       subtitle = \"The proportion of babies with popular names decreases as time goes on, although this trend \n       is much stronger among male names than female ones\", \n       color = \"Name Rank\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Sex)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph clearly depicts a major decrease in the proportion of babies with the most popular male names. Whereas in the late 19th century more than eight percent of boys were named the most popular name of the time, by the early 21st century around one percent of boys are named the highest ranked name.\nFor female names the trend has not been as strong. The first-ranked name follows a pattern similar to the male names, with a major decrease in the proportion of female babies over time. But the second and third most popular female names actually increased in proportion slightly from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century, before declining again. It is noteworthy that the change in proportion of babies with the second and third most popular female names has shifted from four and three percent, respectively, to closer to one percent, which is a much more gradual change than we see with male names. This is in keeping with the visual at the end of research question 1, which showed that popular female baby names are given to fewer babies than popular male names in most generations.\nThese graphs indicate that in more recent years, fewer babies are given the most popular names. Since by definition the most popular names are the names given to the most babies, this indicates that in recent years fewer babies share the same name, and so there are a larger number of unique names overall. We can confirm this with the data.\n\n\nCode\n# Bar graph of number of distinct names by generation\nBabyNames_gen %&gt;% \n  group_by(Generation, Sex) %&gt;% \n  summarize(\"Unique_Names\" = n_distinct(Name)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = Generation, y = Unique_Names, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#F27059\", \"#2A9D8F\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Number of Unique Names in Each Generation, by Sex\", \n      y = \"Number of Unique Names\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, vjust = 0.55)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) { paste0(x / 1000, \"k\")})\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar graph shows that the number of unique names has increased with each generation. While Generation Alpha has slightly fewer unique names than the preceding generation, it is also an “incomplete” generation, in that it includes babies born today and has not ended yet.\nThis bar graph also shows a crucial difference by sex: there are consistently more unique female names than male names. This makes sense given the proportion of babies with popular names - since more male babies are given popular names, there are fewer opportunities for different ones. Likewise, since fewer female babies are named popular names, there are more chances for different names.\nThese graphs all show a trend of increasing name variety correlating with decreasing proportions of babies with the most popular names.\n\n\nOliver vs Christopher: How has the relationship between popularity and proportion changed in recent years?\nIn order to answer the second part of my research question, let’s look specifically at the popularity of the male names Christopher and Oliver. We’ll explore how the number of occurrences, proportion, and ranking of these names change over time. Note that Chris and Christopher are tracked separately in the baby names data, but Christopher has significantly more occurrences on average during the time period we’re interested in.\n\n\nCode\n# compares the average occurrences of the names Chris and Christoper in the 1980s\nBabyNames_prop %&gt;% \n  filter(Sex == \"Male\") %&gt;% \n  group_by(Name) %&gt;% \n  filter(Year &gt;1980 & Year &lt; 1989) %&gt;% \n  filter(Name == \"Christopher\" | Name == \"Chris\") %&gt;% \n  summarize(Avg_Occur = mean(Sum_Occurrences))\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSo for ease of analysis, we’ll just look at Christopher. First let’s compare how Christopher and Oliver have changed in popularity over time, according to the Year_Rank variable.\n\n\nCode\n# graph the ranking of names Oliver and Christopher over time\nOliChri_Rank &lt;- BabyNames_prop %&gt;% \n  filter(Sex == \"Male\") %&gt;% \n  filter(Name %in% c(\"Oliver\", \"Christopher\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Year, Year_Rank, group = as.factor(Name), \n             colour = as.factor(Name))) +  \n  geom_line() +\n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#DB272A\", \"#5887FF\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Oliver vs Christopher: Ranking\", \n       color = \"Name\", \n       y = \"Ranking\")\nOliChri_Rank\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see here that Christopher enjoyed a long streak of popularity from the 1970s until recently. During that time (1970 to 2000), Christopher ranked an average 2.7 of all baby male names in the data.\n\n\nCode\n# shows the average ranking of the name Christopher from 1970 to 2000\nBabyNames_prop %&gt;% \n  filter(Sex == \"Male\") %&gt;% \n  group_by(Name) %&gt;% \n  filter(Year &gt;1970 & Year &lt; 2000) %&gt;% \n  filter(Name == \"Christopher\") %&gt;% \n  summarize(Avg_Rank = mean(Year_Rank))\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe arc of Oliver’s popularity looks quite different. Before the 2000s, Oliver’s peak popularity was when the data was first recorded in 1880. Oliver’s trajectory exemplifies the cyclical nature of popularity that we’ll explore further in research question 3. It’s not until well into the 2000s that Oliver breaks the top 100 and climbs to the third most popular male name in 2021.\nWhile Oliver’s popularity is recent, its ranking is similar to Christopher’s in the 1980s. However, we’ve established that the proportion and occurrences of popular names in general has decreased in recent years. Does this trend remain true when comparing the current Oliver and that of Christopher in the 1980s?\nLet’s compare the proportion of babies that were given the name Oliver and Christopher over time.\n\n\nCode\n# graph the proportion of babies named Oliver and Christopher over time\nOliChri_Prop &lt;- BabyNames_prop %&gt;%\n  filter(Sex == \"Male\") %&gt;% \n  filter(Name %in% c(\"Oliver\", \"Christopher\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Year, Proportion, group = as.factor(Name), \n             colour = as.factor(Name))) +  \n  geom_line() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#DB272A\", \"#5887FF\", \"#00A8E8\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Oliver vs Christopher: Proportion\", \n       subtitle = \"The proportion of babies given this name in a given year.\",  \n       color = \"Name\", \n       y = \"Proportion\")\nOliChri_Prop\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the early 1980s over 3.5% of baby boys were given the name Christopher, while in 2021 just under 1% of boys were named Oliver, even though both names had the same popularity rank in their time. This difference in proportion would imply that Oliver is much less prevalent now than Christopher was in the 1980s, but this doesn’t account for population growth. Does this obscure the true magnitude of babies named Oliver in 2021?\nTo answer this question, let’s compare the total occurrences of each name over time.\n\n\nCode\n# graph the annual occurrences of names Oliver and Christopher over time\nOliChri_Occur &lt;- BabyNames_prop %&gt;% \n  filter(Sex == \"Male\") %&gt;% \n  filter(Name %in% c(\"Oliver\", \"Christopher\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Year, Sum_Occurrences, group = as.factor(Name), \n             colour = as.factor(Name))) +  \n  geom_line() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#DB272A\", \"#5887FF\", \"#00A8E8\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Oliver vs Christopher: Occurrences\", \n       subtitle = \"The total number of babies in the United States given this name in a given year.\",  \n       color = \"Name\", \n       y = \"Occurrences\")\nOliChri_Occur\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph looks very similar to the previous graph and indicates that at peak popularity in 1984 there were just over 60,000 baby boys named Christopher. In the peak of Oliver’s popularity in 2021 under 15,000 boys were named Oliver, less than a quarter of the boys named Christopher in 1984. Of course it’s possible that Oliver’s popularity will continue to climb, but even if it was the ranked the most popular boys name in the United States, the number one name for 2021, Liam, was given to approximately 20,500 boys, still roughly one third of the number of boys with the name Christopher during its peak.\nThese graphs show that even though Christopher and Oliver has the same popularity ranking during their peak (1980s and 2021, respectively), there were significantly fewer baby boys named Oliver in 2021 than there were named Christopher in the 1980s. This reflects the trend seen in earlier of decreasing concentration of babies with popular names, which is especially strong among male names.\nThis is also good news for me, because my baby was born over two years ago now, and we did in fact name him Oliver.\n\n\n\nIs there a cyclical nature to the popularity of some names? Are there some names that were popular in the early part of the 20th century that have regained popularity?\nAccording to the baby name website, Nameberry, the “100 Year Rule” states that baby names cycle into popularity roughly every 100 years.4 Anecdotally, I have witnessed this trend of “vintage baby names” - I know several tiny “Roses”, “Lillians”, and “Margarets”. But is this theory supported by the data?\nIn order to determine if there is truly a cyclical nature to baby name popularity, one would have to analyze a representative sample of this data, if not all of it, and utilize some sort of statistical model that proves the existence of such a pattern. Since this more rigorous method is beyond the scope of this analysis, we’ll instead take a more narrow approach that allows us to confirm if vintage baby names are coming back into fashion and whether this is true for earlier generations as well.\nTo explore this research question, I isolated the data of two sets of two years, 100 years apart.5 The first set will examine the top names in both 1920 and 2020, and the second set will compare top names in 1885 and 1985. I compared the top 100 names in each of the two years and filtered the data to keep only names that appeared on both lists. I then graphed those names on a time series chart to visualize their popularity journey throughout the intervening years.\n\nFemale baby names\n\n\nCode\n# 1885 - 1985\n# Use the Year_Rank variable created earlier to limit the data to just the top 100 names in each year. \nTop1885 &lt;- BabyNames_prop %&gt;% \n  filter(Year == 1885) %&gt;% \n  filter(Year_Rank &lt;=100) \n\nTop1985 &lt;- BabyNames_prop %&gt;% \n  filter(Year == 1985) %&gt;% \n  filter(Year_Rank &lt;=100) \n\n# Join two datasets\nBabyNames_Cyclical85 &lt;- full_join(Top1885, Top1985, by = \"Name\")\n\n# Filter only names appearing in top 100 of both years\nPopCyclical85 &lt;- BabyNames_Cyclical85 %&gt;% \n  filter(Year.x == 1885 & Year.y == 1985) %&gt;% \n  mutate(CombinedRank = Year_Rank.x + Year_Rank.y) %&gt;% \n  arrange(CombinedRank) %&gt;% \n  group_by(Sex.x)\n\n# Clean up this table and rename some of the variables so it's nicer to look at\nPopCyclical85_Table &lt;- PopCyclical85 %&gt;% \n  select(-Sex.y, -Year.x, -Year.y, -Year_Total_Occurrences.x, -Year_Total_Occurrences.y,\n         -Proportion.y, -Proportion.x) %&gt;% \n  setNames(c(\"Sex\", \"Name\", \"1885 Occurrences\", \n             \"1885 Rank\", \"1985 Occurrences\", \"1985 Rank\", \n             \"Combined Rank\"))\n\n# create a color palette for all visualizations for this research question\ncolor_v2 &lt;- c(\"#DB272A\", \"#44AF69\", \"#8390FA\", \"#669BBC\", \n              \"lightsalmon\", \"#00A8E8\", \"#F26419\", \"#5887FF\", \n              \"#E9C46A\", \"darkorchid\", \"darkslateblue\", \n              \"cadetblue\", \"#F58F00\", \"cadetblue1\", \"#F694C1\",\n              \"darkblue\", \"#813405\", \"#1DD3B0\", \"indianred1\", \n              \"darkolivegreen1\")\n\n# plot female name popularity change over time for names popular in 1885 and 1985.\nF_85_Plotly &lt;- BabyNames_prop %&gt;%\n  filter(Sex == \"Female\") %&gt;% \n  filter(Name %in% c(\"Elizabeth\", \"Anna\", \"Sarah\", \"Mary\", \"Laura\", \n                     \"Katherine\", \"Emily\", \"Catherine\", \"Julia\", \"Katie\",\n                     \"Kathryn\", \"Amanda\", \"Margaret\", \"Carrie\", \"Rebecca\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Year, Year_Rank, group = as.factor(Name), \n             colour = as.factor(Name))) +  \n  geom_line() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = c(1885, 1985), linetype = \"dotted\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_y_reverse(limits=c(1350,0)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = color_v2) +\n  labs(title = \"Cyclical Popularity: 1885 and 1985\", \n       subtitle = \"These names were popular for female babies born in 1885 and 1985.\",\n       color = \"Name\", \n       y = \"Ranking\", \n       caption = \"Source: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n# use plotly to show an interactive version of the graph\nggplotly(F_85_Plotly) %&gt;% \n  layout(title = list(text = paste0(\"Names Popular in Both 1885 and 1985 for Female Babies\",\n                                    '&lt;br&gt;',\n                                    '&lt;sup&gt;',\n                                    'The dotted gray lines indicate the key years - 1885 and 1985 (Hover over lines to see names)','&lt;/sup&gt;')))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the 15 female names that were popular (defined as being within the top 100 names given to babies born that year) in both 1885 and in 1985. It shows the ranking of these names for each year in the data, reflecting their changing popularity over time.\nMany of the names in this graph maintain a consistently high ranking in the years in between 1885 and 1985. Only Emily, Amanda, and Katie drop out of the top 250 rankings in the intervening years, and no names drop out of the top 500 names. Most of the names remain in the top 150 names across all years, reflecting a pattern of consistent, rather than cyclical popularity.\nInterestingly, many of the names look to have dropped more quickly out of the high rankings after 1985, led by the precipitous fall of the name Carrie (perhaps influenced by the 1976 horror film of the same name).\nLet’s take a look at the most popular names that were given to female babies in both 1920 and 2020.\n\n\nCode\n# 1920 - 2020\n# Use the Year_Rank variable I created earlier to limit the data to just the top 100 names in each year. \nTop1920 &lt;- BabyNames_prop %&gt;% \n  filter(Year == 1920) %&gt;% \n  filter(Year_Rank &lt;=100) \n\nTop2020 &lt;- BabyNames_prop %&gt;% \n  filter(Year == 2020) %&gt;% \n  filter(Year_Rank &lt;=100) \n\n# Join two datasets\nBabyNames_Cyclical20 &lt;- full_join(Top1920, Top2020, by = \"Name\")\n\n# Filter only names appearing in top 100 of both years\nPopCyclical20 &lt;- BabyNames_Cyclical20 %&gt;% \n  filter(Year.x == 1920 & Year.y == 2020) %&gt;% \n  mutate(CombinedRank = Year_Rank.x + Year_Rank.y) %&gt;% \n  arrange(CombinedRank) %&gt;% \n  group_by(Sex.x)\n\n# Clean up this table and rename some of the variables so it's nicer to look at\nPopCyclical20_Table &lt;- PopCyclical20 %&gt;% \n  select(-Sex.y, -Year.x, -Year.y, -Year_Total_Occurrences.x, -Year_Total_Occurrences.y,\n         -Proportion.y, -Proportion.x) %&gt;% \n  setNames(c(\"Sex\", \"Name\", \"1920 Occurrences\", \n             \"1920 Rank\", \"2020 Occurrences\", \"2020 Rank\", \n             \"Combined Rank\"))\n\n# plot female name popularity change over time for names popular in 1920 and 2020\nF_20_Plotly &lt;- BabyNames_prop %&gt;%\n  filter(Sex == \"Female\") %&gt;% \n  filter(Name %in% c(\"Elizabeth\", \"Anna\", \"Sarah\", \"Evelyn\", \"Charlotte\", \n                     \"Eleanor\", \"Emma\", \"Lillian\", \"Alice\", \"Hazel\",\n                     \"Grace\", \"Ruby\", \"Ella\", \"Stella\", \"Violet\", \n                     \"Eva\", \"Lucy\", \"Josephine\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Year, Year_Rank, group = as.factor(Name), \n             colour = as.factor(Name))) +  \n  geom_line() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = c(1920, 2020), linetype = \"dotted\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_y_reverse(limits=c(1350,0)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = color_v2) +\n  labs(title = \"Cyclical Popularity: 1920 and 2020\", \n       subtitle = \"These names were popular for female babies born in 1920 and 2020.\",\n       color = \"Name\", \n       y = \"Ranking\")\n\n# use plotly to show an interactive version of the graph\nggplotly(F_20_Plotly) %&gt;% \n  layout(title = list(text = paste0(\"Names Popular in Both 1920 and 2020 for Female Babies\",\n                                    '&lt;br&gt;',\n                                    '&lt;sup&gt;',\n                                    'The dotted gray lines indicate the key years - 1920 and 2020 (Hover over lines to see names)','&lt;/sup&gt;')))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks markedly different than the previous graph with data from 35 years earlier. There is a much more dramatic drop in popularity among most of the names captured in this graph. Most of the names here, except for Elizabeth, Sarah, and Anna, dropped below the top 250 at some point between 1920 and 2020. Four names, Hazel, Ella, Stella, and Violet, even dropped out of the top 1,000 names during that time period.\nFinally, let’s take a look at the same years for male baby names.\n\n\nMale baby names\n\n\nCode\n# larger color vector for 1885/1985 male names graph\ncolor_v3 &lt;- c(\"#DB272A\", \"#44AF69\", \"#8390FA\", \"#669BBC\", \n              \"lightsalmon\", \"#00A8E8\", \"#F26419\", \"#5887FF\", \n              \"#E9C46A\", \"darkorchid\", \"darkslateblue\", \n              \"cadetblue\", \"#F58F00\", \"cadetblue1\", \"#F694C1\",\n              \"darkblue\", \"#813405\", \"#1DD3B0\", \"indianred1\", \n              \"darkolivegreen1\", \"salmon\", \"cornflowerblue\", \n              \"orange\", \"red\", \"black\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"purple\",\n              \"yellow\", \"maroon\")\n\n# 1885 - 1985\n\n# plot male name popularity change over time for names popular in 1885 and 1985\nM_85_Plotly &lt;- BabyNames_prop %&gt;%\n  filter(Sex == \"Male\") %&gt;% \n  filter(Name %in% c(\"James\", \"John\", \"Joseph\", \"Robert\", \"William\", \n                     \"David\", \"Thomas\", \"Daniel\", \"Charles\", \"Andrew\",\n                     \"Michael\", \"Richard\", \"Benjamin\", \"Edward\", \"Samuel\",\n                     \"George\", \"Jesse\", \"Paul\", \"Jacob\", \"Peter\",\n                     \"Frank\", \"Patrick\", \"Anthony\", \"Alexander\", \"Stephen\",\n                     \"Raymond\", \"Alex\", \"Philip\", \"Victor\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Year, Year_Rank, group = as.factor(Name), \n             colour = as.factor(Name))) +  \n  geom_line() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = c(1885, 1985), linetype = \"dotted\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_y_reverse(limits=c(675,0)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = color_v3) +\n  labs(title = \"Cyclical Popularity: 1885 and 1985\", \n       subtitle = \"These names were popular for male babies born in 1885 and 1985.\",\n       color = \"Name\", \n       y = \"Ranking\", \n       caption = \"Source: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/\")\n\n# use plotly to show an interactive version of the graph\nggplotly(M_85_Plotly) %&gt;% \n  layout(title = list(text = paste0(\"Names Popular in Both 1885 and 1985 for Male Babies\",\n                                    '&lt;br&gt;',\n                                    '&lt;sup&gt;',\n                                    'The dotted gray lines indicate the key years - 1885 and 1985 (Hover over lines to see names)','&lt;/sup&gt;')))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# 1920 - 2020\n# plot male name popularity change over time for names popular in 1920 and 2020\nM_20_Plotly &lt;- BabyNames_prop %&gt;%\n  filter(Sex == \"Male\") %&gt;% \n  filter(Name %in% c(\"William\", \"James\", \"Henry\", \"John\", \"Joseph\", \"Jack\", \n                     \"Charles\", \"David\", \"Thomas\", \"Michael\", \"Daniel\", \"Samuel\", \n                     \"Robert\", \"Anthony\", \"Leo\", \"Theodore\", \"Benjamin\", \"Andrew\", \n                     \"Everett\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Year, Year_Rank, group = as.factor(Name), \n             colour = as.factor(Name))) +  \n  geom_line() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = c(1920, 2020), linetype = \"dotted\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_y_reverse(limits=c(675,0)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = color_v2) +\n  labs(title = \"Cyclical Popularity: 1920 and 2020\", \n       subtitle = \"These names were popular for males babies born in 1920 and 2020.\",\n       color = \"Name\", \n       y = \"Ranking\", \n       caption = \"Source: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/\")\n\n# use plotly to show an interactive version of the graph\nggplotly(M_20_Plotly) %&gt;% \n  layout(title = list(text = paste0(\"Names Popular in Both 1920 and 2020 for Male Babies\",\n                                    '&lt;br&gt;',\n                                    '&lt;sup&gt;',\n                                    'The dotted gray lines indicate the key years - 1920 and 2020 (Hover over lines to see names)','&lt;/sup&gt;')))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to the female names, both of these graphs show much less variation in popularity ranking over time. Note that the y-axes are half what they are on the graphs with female names, reflecting the fact that none of the male names that were popular in both 1885 and 1985 and in both 1920 and 2020 dropped very far in popularity in the intervening periods. In fact the only names to drop out of the top 200 are Jacob, Alex, and Alexander in the 1885/1985 set, and Everett, Leo, and Theodore, in the 1920/2020 set.\nIt is also worth noting that in both the 1885/1985 and 1920/2020 sets, there were more male names that were popular in the two years of each set than there were female names. There were 29 male names popular in both 1885 and 1985, as opposed to 15 female names, and 19 male names popular in both 1920 and 2020, as opposed to 18 female names.\nThis analysis shows that for male names in both sets and female names in the 1885/1985 set, we see a more consistent popularity over the time period studied (with some exceptions), as opposed to the cyclical pattern among most of the female names in the 1920/2020 set. Given the fact that three out of the four sets examined do not show a pattern of cyclical popularity, our hypothesis that baby names cycle into popularity every 100 years is not strongly supported. Then what could explain the pattern we see among female names in 1920 and 2020?\nThe Atlantic’s Megan Garber describes what she calls the “Paradox of Baby Names,” in which parents’ efforts to give their child an original and uncommon name results in unconventional names topping the annual popularity lists.6 As Garber puts it, “the names parents selected, presumably, at least in part for their uniqueness became, in short order, the opposite of unique.” Garber states that parents “look to lists like the SSA’s not for ideas for names, but for ideas for names to avoid.” I suspect this is the reason we see vintage baby names, such as Violet and Hazel, reappearing on the list of top female names in 2020. Parents are reaching back in history, beyond the names they consider popular, to names that they think of as unique and uncommon.\nThis theory would explain why babies born in the 1980’s had names that were more consistently popular, since the preference for individuality is a more recent trend. This would also help to explain why we see some of the names from the 1885/1985 set dropping out of popularity toward the beginning of the 21st century. By definition, their long run of popularity makes them much less attractive to the parents of the 21st century looking for unique and uncommon names for their children."

    "section": "Discussion and Limitations",
    "text": "Discussion and Limitations\n\nIncomplete Data: A boy named sue\nMany of the limitations of the data were described in the notes provided by the Social Security Administration and detailed in the Data Introduction section above. These notes stated that before 1937 many people did not apply for a Social Security card, and so their data would be missing. Any records that were not complete are also not included in this data. It was also noted that this data is not edited, and some errors may be present. While the errors described, such as names recorded as “Baby” and “Unknown”, were removed from this data as part of the data cleaning process, there are undoubtedly more mistakes and it is not possible to account for and correct all of them. For instance, while working on this analysis I noted that there are many instances of names being recorded the wrong sex. While it’s quite possible that some parents were creative with their name choice and certainly gender neutral names have increased in recent years, it’s unlikely that those reasons account for all 15,172 cases of boys named Mary, or the 519 boys in this dataset named Sue. On a related note, because the data did not track gender neutral names, it was not possible to explore changes in gendered names in this analysis.\nThe Social Security Administration also specifies that names must be at least two characters long and that there must be at least five occurrences of a name in a state in order to make it on the list, likely meaning that many names were not included. Given all of these issues, the dataset should be understood to not be entirely complete, and so any understanding of the analysis must be considered in this context.\nAnother limitation of the data that may have affected the analysis is the fact that names with different spellings were recorded as separate names, so the popularity of a name with a variety of spellings may have been obscured. This was particularly notable in research question 3, when this analysis showed that out of the 15 female names that were popular in both 1885 and 1985, three of them were variations on Katherine (or Catherine, or Kathryn) and one was Katie. The prominence of these names suggests that if there was a singular spelling this name would have emerged as one of the most popular names during that time, and not what we saw in research question 1, that Katherine (or any variation) never cracked the top five names of a generation. Further research could seek to combine the occurrences of the names with spelling variations so that their popularity was more accurately captured.\n\n\nSex Ratio Discrepancy\nWhile conducting this analysis, I noticed that there was an especially large difference between the number of female and male baby name occurrences for each year. Since the occurrences count the total number of babies named and not the total number of distinct names, any difference between the sexes should reflect the real life sex ratio of babies born in the United States. In order to investigate this further, I calculated the sex ratio per generation to get a sense of the overall discrepancy between the sexes in the data.\n\n\nCode\n# create an average sex ratio variable and show per generation\nBabyNames_gen %&gt;% \n  group_by(Year, Sex, Generation) %&gt;% \n  summarize(Sum_Occurrences = sum(Occurrences)) %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Sex, values_from = Sum_Occurrences) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Sex_Ratio = Male/Female) %&gt;% \n  group_by(Generation) %&gt;% \n  summarize(\"Average Sex Ratio\" = mean(Sex_Ratio))\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis table shows that there are more occurrences of female babies for the first three generations (1880-1945), and there are more male babies in the last five generations (1946-2021). According to several sources, there is in fact a sex discrepancy at birth: approximately 105 male births occurring for every 100 female births.7 This suggests that the sex ratio in this data is actually fairly close to the truth - there are more boys born every year than girls. It’s possible that other limitations of the data affect one sex more than the other, which could account for the remaining discrepancy between the real sex ratio and the sex ratio found in the data. For instance, since this analysis found that there are more unique female names and fewer female babies share the same name (compared to male babies), it’s possible that the policy of leaving out names when there were fewer than five per state, disproportionately excluded more female babies. In addition, since the Social Security Administration specifically stated that data before 1937 was incomplete, it is likely that this plays a significant role in the uneven sex ratio during those years."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe research questions explored in this analysis provide a compelling portrait of the most popular baby names in the United States, the trends that have shaped baby name choices made by American parents, and how this has evolved from the late 19th to the early 21st century.\nTwo prevailing trends were established and explored in the data:\n\nDiversity in baby names has increased, while the proportion of babies with the same name has decreased. At the start of the time period covered in this data, there were fewer unique names and more babies had the same name. As time went on, there were more unique names, and each name was given to fewer babies. There are many demographic and cultural shifts that have likely played a role in this trend, including increasing ethnic and cultural diversity in the United States, but it has also likely been driven by a shift away from tradition and toward individualism. As the Atlantic’s Philip Cohen states, “Conformity to tradition has been replaced by conformity to individuality.”8\nRelatedly, while this analysis shows that some names that were popular 100 years ago are now coming back into fashion, this may be evidence of the trend toward individualism rather than a sign of a larger cyclical pattern. This “vintage baby names” trend is stronger among female names in recent years, as female names from earlier generations and male names from both time periods tend to be more consistently popular over time and rarely drop out of the most popular names.\nNaming trends vary by sex. There is a higher concentration of babies with popular male names over all time periods, except for the most recent generation when it is roughly equal with female names. As with male names, the most popular female names are given to fewer babies now than in previous generations, but since female names have started out with more variation the change over time was less dramatic. Male names tended to be more consistently popular over time than female names, while the “vintage baby names” trend, where popular names dropped out of popularity and resurfaced a century later, was much more prevalent among female names.\n\nFinally, on a personal note, these findings mean that I am not alone in my generation in wanting a unique name for my child. Luckily, since so many other parents are avoiding common names, I can give my baby a highly-ranked name and know that even though it is popular, it’s not nearly as ubiquitous as popular names used to be."

But the variation in the length of generations and the distance between generations made it difficult to evaluate this trend in a systematic way, which is why I instead used two sets of years 100 years apart. When I ran this analysis with the `Generation` variable I looked at six different combinations of generations and found an interesting pattern. Earlier generation pairs (such as the Lost Generation and Generation X or the Greatest Generation and the Millennial Generation) had a set of names that were popular in both, but they didn’t show a strong pattern of *cyclical* popularity. When I graphed the rankings of those names over time it showed that most of the names popular in both generations had stayed fairly popular (defined as being within the top 100 or 150 names in a year) throughout the years between the two generations in question - so their popularity was steady and consistent, not cyclical. More recent generation pairings (such as the Greatest Generation and Generation Alpha), however, did show a strong pattern of cyclical popularity. Many of the names that were popular in both generations had cycled out of popularity in the intervening years, with some names, such as Hazel, Ella, Stella, and Violet, even dropping below the 1000 most popular names before rising back up to the top 100. This analysis showed that the popularity of some names is cyclical, but moreso for names in recent years. Since the length of generations and the distance between generations is not standardized I was curious to see if this pattern of the cyclical nature of popularity being more predominant in recent years would hold true if I took a more systematic approach to evaluating the 100 year rule.↩︎\nGarber, M.

    "text": "Introduction and Research Questions\nDespite advancements in health and technology, maternal mortality remains a significant public health challenge around the world. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 287,000 women died from complications related to pregnancy or childbirth in 2020.1 Recently it was reported that global declines in maternal mortality have stalled,2 even increased in the United States,3 and data from 2020 has shown the pandemic brought a sharp uptick in maternal deaths.4 The World Health Organization has stated that the majority of maternal deaths are preventable.5\nPast research has investigated factors associated with higher rates of maternal mortality, both at the level of the individual and country. Many studies have found that factors associated with maternal healthcare, such as the presence of a skilled attendant at birth and antenatal visits, are strongly associated with maternal mortality.6 7 Other studies considering social determinants of health have found that factors such as adult literacy, education, national income levels, and access to water and sanitation are all associated with maternal mortality.8 9 The majority of maternal deaths occur in low-income countries.10\nThis research intends to explore the relationship between women’s political inclusion and maternal mortality, while controlling for confounding variables related to the development of a nation’s economy, health sector, and political system. In addition, this research will examine the mechanism through which women’s political inclusion might impact maternal mortality by considering the percentage of skilled attendants at birth as a mediator variable.\nPast research has found a link between higher levels of gender equality and women’s political inclusion and reduced maternal mortality, although analysis has primarily focused on individual countries or a subset of countries (typically lower-income).11 12 This research will investigate whether these trends hold true when looking at over 150 countries from all levels of economic development.\nIn short, this analysis seeks to answer the following two research questions:\n\nDoes gender exclusion have an effect on maternal mortality?\nIs the effect of women’s political inclusion on maternal mortality mediated by the presence of skilled attendants at birth?"

    "text": "Hypotheses\nHypothesis 1: Where gender exclusion is low and political inclusion of women is high, health outcomes are better and maternal mortality is low. This will hold true even when controlling for variables which are known to have an effect on both women’s political inclusion and maternal mortality.\nHypothesis 2: The political inclusion and empowerment of women has a positive effect on national maternal health infrastructure and specifically the increase of skilled attendants present at birth, which in turn has the effect of reducing maternal mortality. In other words, the relationship between gender exclusion and maternal mortality is mediated by the presence of skilled attendants at birth.\nIn investigating these two hypotheses, this analysis will explore the link between the political inclusion of women and reduced maternal mortality and try to provide insight into the mechanism through which this occurs."

    "section": "Introduction to the Data",
    "text": "Introduction to the Data\nThis research will utilize several datasets in order to capture all of the relevant variables.\n\nDependent variable\nThe dependent variable, Maternal Mortality Ratio, is drawn from the Maternal and newborn health table from UNICEF. This data is from 2017.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as: “the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period.”\nMaternal deaths are defined as: “deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy…”14\n\n\n\n\nExplanatory variable\nThe explanatory variable featured in this analysis will be drawn from the Varieties of Democracy V-Dem dataset.15 From there, the following variable will be used:\n\n(Political) exclusion by gender index16\nAs defined by the V-Dem codebook: “Exclusion is when individuals are denied access to services or participation in governed spaces (spaces that are part of the public space and the government should regulate, while excluding private spaces and organizations except when exclusion in those private spheres is linked to exclusion in the public sphere) based on their identity or belonging to a particular group.”17 This index is formed from four other indicators from V-Dem: power distributed by gender, equality in respect for civil liberites by gender, access to public services by gender, access to state jobs by gender, and access to state business opportunities by gender.\n\nThis variable is on an interval scale, from low to high (0-1). The codebook notes that the point estimates are reversed here, so unlike most of the variables from V-Dem, for this variable the “lower scores indicate a normatively better situation…and higher scores a normatively worse situation”.18 So higher values of this variable indicate more gender exclusion and less political inclusion of women. In order to match the timeframe of the dependent variable, the 2017 values have been used for this analysis.\n\n\nMediator variable\nIn addition to the dependent and explanatory variables, a mediator variable will also be considered in this analysis. As noted above, research has shown that the presence of skilled attendants at birth has a negative effect on maternal mortality.19 The second hypothesis of this research is that more political inclusion of women will improve national maternal healthcare and have the effect of increasing the percentage of births with a skilled attendant, which will in turn reduce maternal mortality. The mediator variable is the percentage of births that occur with a skilled attendant in each country, and it will be drawn from the same Maternal and newborn health table from UNICEF that the maternal mortality data is from.20\n\n\nConfounding variables\nThree confounding variables that seek to account for the economic and political development of a country will be considered in order to control for their effect on both maternal mortality and women’s political exclusion.\nGDP per capita will be used as a way to control for a nation’s economic development. This variable is drawn from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s data.21 GDP per capita from 2017 will be used in order to be consistent with the rest of the data.\nIn addition to GDP, this analysis will also include a confounding variable on the government expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP. This will be drawn from the Economic Indicators table from UNICEF. This data is from 2017.22\nFinally, a variable capturing the level of democracy in a country will be used as a confounding variable in this analysis. This variable was drawn from the V-Dems data.23 According to the codebook, this variable was “computed by subtracting the autocracy score from the democracy score. The resulting unified POLITY scale ranges from +10 (strongly democratic) to -10 (strongly autocratic).”24 This variable will seek to control for social and political elements that may effect both gender exclusion and maternal mortality.\nThe resulting data used for analysis will be a cross-sectional, cross-national sample of data from 155 countries (some observations were removed because of missing values) on all of the variables noted here: maternal mortality, skilled birth attendants, gender exclusion, GDP, percentage of GDP spent on health, and democracy. All variables are for the year 2017."

In addition there are two variables created for this analysis that provide the quartile in which a country’s GDP falls, and the logged GDP. This data should provide us with the key variables and confounding variables to examine and analyze the relationship between the explanatory variable (GenderExclusion) and the dependent variable (Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017), as well as the possible role of a mediator variable (SkilledBirthAtt).\n\nDependent variable\nAs noted above, the dependent variable for this research is the national maternal mortality ratio of each country in 2017. The following heatmap shows the Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 in each country in the data. Note that darker shades indicate a higher maternal mortality rate.\n\n\nCode\n# Load the world map data\nworld &lt;- map_data(\"world\")\n\n## change the MNH data into what you need for the maps. select two variables, \n# change the variable names for joining\nMapMMR &lt;- MMR_Analysis %&gt;% \n  select(Country, Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017, GenderExclusion, SkilledBirthAtt) %&gt;% \n  rename(region = Country)\n\n# Use stringr::str_replace to edit the country names under the region variable\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Bolivia\", \"Bolivia (Plurinational State of)\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Brunei\", \"Brunei Darussalam\") \nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Cape Verde\", \"Cabo Verde\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Congo\", \"Republic of Congo\") \nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Ivory Coast\", \"Côte d'Ivoire\") \nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Czech Republic\", \"Czechia\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"North Korea\", \"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Micronesia\", \"Micronesia (Federated States of)\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Iran\", \"Iran (Islamic Republic of)\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Laos\", \"Lao People's Democratic Republic\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"South Korea\", \"Republic of Korea\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Moldova\", \"Republic of Moldova\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Russia\", \"Russian Federation\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Palestine\", \"State of Palestine\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Syria\", \"Syrian Arab Republic\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Tanzania\", \"United Republic of Tanzania\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"UK\", \"United Kingdom\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"USA\", \"United States\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Venezuela\", \"Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)\")\nworld$region &lt;- str_replace(world$region, \"Vietnam\", \"Viet Nam\")\n\n# Merge the world map data with the numeric data\nworld_data &lt;- full_join(world, MapMMR, by = \"region\") \n\n# Plot the map\nggplot(world_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017)) +\n  geom_polygon() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"#EFE5E2\", high = \"#881c1c\") +\n  labs(title = \"Maternal Mortality Ratio Around the World\",\n       subtitle = \"Darker shades of red indicate a higher maternal mortality ratio\",\n       caption = \"Data from UNICEF: https://data.unicef.org (2017)\", \n       fill = \"MMR\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of the Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 is right skewed, indicating that most countries in the data have low values for this variable.

Democracy and Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 have the weakest correlation. The strongest correlation on this graph is between Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 and SkilledBirthAtt, which is a negative relationship. The variable logGDP2017 has a strong negative correlation with Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017, and a strong positive correlation with Expend_Health_pct_GDP. The variable that has the strongest correlation with the explanatory variable GenderExclusion, is Expend_Health_pct_GDP and it is a negative correlation. The explanatory variable also shows a strong negative correlation with SkilledBirthAtt and logGDP2017. Democracy looks to have the lowest correlations with other variables in this analysis.\nThe following scatterplot shows the positive relationship between the key variables of this analysis, Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 and GenderExclusion.

    "text": "Analysis\nThe visuals above suggest some significant relationships between variables. This section will explore the research questions with correlation tests and regression analysis.\n\nHypothesis #1\nHypothesis #1 states that where gender exclusion is low and political inclusion of women is high, health outcomes are better and maternal mortality is low. This will hold true even when controlling for variables which are known to have an effect on both women’s political inclusion and maternal mortality.\nHow does the explanatory variable (GenderExclusion) relate to the dependent variable (Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017)?\nA correlation test shows that the explanatory variable (GenderExclusion) and the dependent variable (Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017) have a moderate positive correlation. The p-value here is small and indicates this relationship is statistically significant.\n\n\nCode\ncor.test(MMR_Analysis$Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017, MMR_Analysis$GenderExclusion)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  MMR_Analysis$Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 and MMR_Analysis$GenderExclusion\nt = 5.6182, df = 153, p-value = 8.877e-08\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.2737461 0.5362357\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.4135474 \n\n\nAs noted above, the Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 has a right-skewed distribution, so a logged version of the variable should be considered. This is also the case for the GenderExclusion variable. Different combinations of logged versions of these variables will be compared here.\n\n\nCode\nMMR_Analysis &lt;- mutate(MMR_Analysis, \"logMMR2017\" = log(Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017))\nMMR_Analysis &lt;- mutate(MMR_Analysis, \"logGenderExclusion\" = log(GenderExclusion))\n\ncor.test(MMR_Analysis$logMMR2017, MMR_Analysis$GenderExclusion)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  MMR_Analysis$logMMR2017 and MMR_Analysis$GenderExclusion\nt = 7.8117, df = 153, p-value = 8.383e-13\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.4109084 0.6379160\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.5339668 \n\n\nCode\ncor.test(MMR_Analysis$logMMR2017, MMR_Analysis$logGenderExclusion)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  MMR_Analysis$logMMR2017 and MMR_Analysis$logGenderExclusion\nt = 10.12, df = 153, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.5282982 0.7190763\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.6332094 \n\n\nCode\ncor.test(MMR_Analysis$Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017, MMR_Analysis$logGenderExclusion)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  MMR_Analysis$Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 and MMR_Analysis$logGenderExclusion\nt = 5.8772, df = 153, p-value = 2.52e-08\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.2912203 0.5496274\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.4291654 \n\n\nA comparison of these correlation tests shows that the highest correlation is with the logged versions of the variables, logGenderExclusion and logMMR2017. These variables should be compared in the linear regression analysis as well.\nA linear regression analysis also shows a significant relationship between the explanatory variable (GenderExclusion) and the dependent variable (Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017) and the logged versions.\n\n\nCode\n# Model with only the explanatory variable and the dependent variable\nMMR_nolog &lt;- (lm(formula = Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 ~ GenderExclusion,\n                              data = MMR_Analysis))\n\nGElog &lt;- (lm(formula = Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 ~ logGenderExclusion,\n                              data = MMR_Analysis))\n\nMMRlog &lt;- (lm(formula = logMMR2017 ~ GenderExclusion,\n                              data = MMR_Analysis))\n\nAllLog &lt;- (lm(formula = logMMR2017 ~ logGenderExclusion,\n                              data = MMR_Analysis))\n\nstargazer(MMR_nolog, GElog, MMRlog, AllLog, type = 'text') \n\n\n\n==================================================================================\n                                               Dependent variable:                \n                               ---------------------------------------------------\n                               Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017       logMMR2017     \n                                     (1)            (2)          (3)       (4)    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGenderExclusion                  414.685***                   3.789***            \n                                  (73.811)                     (0.485)            \n                                                                                  \nlogGenderExclusion                               106.717***              1.114*** \n                                                  (18.158)               (0.110)  \n                                                                                  \nConstant                           32.225        327.106***   2.725***   5.616*** \n                                  (31.274)        (31.057)     (0.206)   (0.188)  \n                                                                                  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nObservations                         155            155          155       155    \nR2                                  0.171          0.184        0.285     0.401   \nAdjusted R2                         0.166          0.179        0.280     0.397   \nResidual Std.

The R^2 and adjusted R^2 values are much higher for this model than the models with only one logged variable or no logged variables. For this reason, the rest of the models in this analysis will use the logMMR2017 in place of the Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 variable and the logGenderExclusion in place of the GenderExclusion variable.26\nNext, the model will be explored with confounding variables added in.\n\n\nCode\n# Explore the regression model with all of the confounding variables.\nsummary(lm(formula = logMMR2017 ~ logGenderExclusion +\n                                Democracy + \n                                SkilledBirthAtt +\n                                logGDP2017 +\n                                Expend_Health_pct_GDP,\n                              data = MMR_Analysis))\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = logMMR2017 ~ logGenderExclusion + Democracy + SkilledBirthAtt + \n    logGDP2017 + Expend_Health_pct_GDP, data = MMR_Analysis)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-2.54176 -0.49592 -0.01031  0.54233  1.84184 \n\nCoefficients:\n                       Estimate Std.

The interaction term was also not significant, indicating that we do not need to keep it. The model without the interaction term or the Expend_Health_pct_GDP variable has the lowest R^2 value, although that may be because it has fewer variables than the other two models.

While the logGenderExclusion variable was found to have a more significant effect on logMMR2017 without any confounders, once control variables were introduced, the model became stronger and a better fit and the effect of logGenderExclusion remained statistically significant.\n\n\nCode\nsummary(MMR_3)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = logMMR2017 ~ logGenderExclusion + Democracy + SkilledBirthAtt + \n    logGDP2017, data = MMR_Analysis)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-2.59404 -0.49573 -0.05322  0.54132  1.87132 \n\nCoefficients:\n                    Estimate Std.

This hypothesis proposes that the empowerment and political inclusion of women in a country has a positive effect on the maternal health infrastructure and specifically on the presence of skilled attendants at birth, which in turn has the effect of reducing maternal mortality. As discussed in the introduction, previous research has identified the presence of a skilled attendant at birth as a factor that reduces the incidence of maternal mortality.27 28 This research question seeks to determine whether the presence of a skilled birth attendant acts as a mediator between the explanatory variable and the dependent variable in this analysis.\nThe process of mediation analysis involves identifying a model that shows the total effect (the effect of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable without the presence of the mediator variable), and two models that show indirect effect (the effect between the explanatory variable and the mediator, and the mediator and the dependent variable while controlling for the explanatory variable). Following that, these models are processed through the mediate() function, which estimates the mediation relationship.\n\n\nCode\n# Total effect model (effect of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable without the presence of the mediator variable).

This was not found to be significant.\nADE (average direct effects) shows the direct effect of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable. This was also calculated in the second indirect effect model above. In both cases the relationship between the explanatory variable and the dependent variable was found to be significant at the 0.001 (.1%) level.\nThe Total Effect reports the sum of the direct and indirect effects of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable. This was also found in the first step of this process when the total effect was calculated. In both cases, the effect of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable was found to be significant at the 0.001 (.1%) level.\nFinally, Prop. Mediated indicates the proportion of the effect of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable that goes through the mediator. The ACME has already shown that the explanatory variable’s effect on the dependent variable does not go through the mediator, so this is also not significant.\nIn sum, this model shows that while gender exclusion has a direct effect on maternal mortality, there is no statistically significant evidence that this effect is mediated via the presence of skilled birth attendants."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis analysis supports the first hypothesis, that where gender exclusion is low and political inclusion of women is high, maternal mortality is also lower. This held true even when controlling for democracy, GDP, and the presence of skilled birth attendants.\nThis analysis did not, however, support the hypothesis that the effect of political inclusion of women on maternal mortality was mediated by the presence of skilled attendants at birth. In fact, this research found that women’s political inclusion did not have a significant effect on the presence of skilled birth attendants. This suggests that the way in which women’s political inclusion and empowerment impacts maternal mortality is through another mechanism that was not explored in this analysis."

    "text": "Introduction and Research Questions\nDespite advancements in health and technology, maternal mortality remains a significant public health challenge around the world. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 287,000 women died from complications related to pregnancy or childbirth in 2020.1 Recently it was reported that global declines in maternal mortality have stalled,2 even increased in the United States,3 and data from 2020 has shown the pandemic brought a sharp uptick in maternal deaths.4 The World Health Organization has stated that the majority of maternal deaths are preventable.5\nPast research has investigated factors associated with higher rates of maternal mortality, both at the level of the individual and country. Many studies have found that factors associated with maternal healthcare, such as the presence of a skilled attendant at birth and antenatal visits, are strongly associated with maternal mortality.6 7 Other studies considering social determinants of health have found that factors such as adult literacy, education, national income levels, and access to water and sanitation are all associated with maternal mortality.8 9 The majority of maternal deaths occur in low-income countries.10\nThis research intends to explore the relationship between women’s political inclusion and maternal mortality, while controlling for confounding variables related to the development of a nation’s economy, health sector, and political system. In addition, this research will examine the mechanism through which women’s political inclusion might impact maternal mortality by considering the percentage of skilled attendants at birth as a mediator variable.\nPast research has found a link between higher levels of gender equality and women’s political inclusion and reduced maternal mortality, although analysis has primarily focused on individual countries or a subset of countries (typically lower-income).11 12 This research will investigate whether these trends hold true when looking at over 150 countries from all levels of economic development.\nIn short, this analysis seeks to answer the following two research questions:\n\nDoes gender exclusion have an effect on maternal mortality?\nIs the effect of women’s political inclusion on maternal mortality mediated by the presence of skilled attendants at birth?"

    "text": "Hypotheses\nHypothesis 1: Where gender exclusion is low and political inclusion of women is high, health outcomes are better and maternal mortality is low. This will hold true even when controlling for variables which are known to have an effect on both women’s political inclusion and maternal mortality.\nHypothesis 2: The political inclusion and empowerment of women has a positive effect on national maternal health infrastructure and specifically the increase of skilled attendants present at birth, which in turn has the effect of reducing maternal mortality. In other words, the relationship between gender exclusion and maternal mortality is mediated by the presence of skilled attendants at birth.\nIn investigating these two hypotheses, this analysis will explore the link between the political inclusion of women and reduced maternal mortality and try to provide insight into the mechanism through which this occurs."

    "section": "Introduction to the Data",
    "text": "Introduction to the Data\nThis research will utilize several datasets in order to capture all of the relevant variables.\n\nDependent variable\nThe dependent variable, Maternal Mortality Ratio, is drawn from the Maternal and newborn health table from UNICEF. This data is from 2017.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as: “the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period.”\nMaternal deaths are defined as: “deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy…”14\n\n\n\n\nExplanatory variable\nThe explanatory variable featured in this analysis will be drawn from the Varieties of Democracy V-Dem dataset.15 From there, the following variable will be used:\n\n(Political) exclusion by gender index16\nAs defined by the V-Dem codebook: “Exclusion is when individuals are denied access to services or participation in governed spaces (spaces that are part of the public space and the government should regulate, while excluding private spaces and organizations except when exclusion in those private spheres is linked to exclusion in the public sphere) based on their identity or belonging to a particular group.”17 This index is formed from four other indicators from V-Dem: power distributed by gender, equality in respect for civil liberites by gender, access to public services by gender, access to state jobs by gender, and access to state business opportunities by gender.\n\nThis variable is on an interval scale, from low to high (0-1). The codebook notes that the point estimates are reversed here, so unlike most of the variables from V-Dem, for this variable the “lower scores indicate a normatively better situation…and higher scores a normatively worse situation”.18 So higher values of this variable indicate more gender exclusion and less political inclusion of women. In order to match the timeframe of the dependent variable, the 2017 values have been used for this analysis.\n\n\nMediator variable\nIn addition to the dependent and explanatory variables, a mediator variable will also be considered in this analysis. As noted above, research has shown that the presence of skilled attendants at birth has a negative effect on maternal mortality.19 The second hypothesis of this research is that more political inclusion of women will improve national maternal healthcare and have the effect of increasing the percentage of births with a skilled attendant, which will in turn reduce maternal mortality. The mediator variable is the percentage of births that occur with a skilled attendant in each country, and it will be drawn from the same Maternal and newborn health table from UNICEF that the maternal mortality data is from.20\n\n\nConfounding variables\nThree confounding variables that seek to account for the economic and political development of a country will be considered in order to control for their effect on both maternal mortality and women’s political exclusion.\nGDP per capita will be used as a way to control for a nation’s economic development. This variable is drawn from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s data.21 GDP per capita from 2017 will be used in order to be consistent with the rest of the data.\nIn addition to GDP, this analysis will also include a confounding variable on the government expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP. This will be drawn from the Economic Indicators table from UNICEF. This data is from 2017.22\nFinally, a variable capturing the level of democracy in a country will be used as a confounding variable in this analysis. This variable was drawn from the V-Dems data.23 According to the codebook, this variable was “computed by subtracting the autocracy score from the democracy score. The resulting unified POLITY scale ranges from +10 (strongly democratic) to -10 (strongly autocratic).”24 This variable will seek to control for social and political elements that may effect both gender exclusion and maternal mortality.\nThe resulting data used for analysis will be a cross-sectional, cross-national sample of data from 155 countries (some observations were removed because of missing values) on all of the variables noted here: maternal mortality, skilled birth attendants, gender exclusion, GDP, percentage of GDP spent on health, and democracy. All variables are for the year 2017."

    "text": "Analysis\nThe visuals above suggest some significant relationships between variables. This section will explore the research questions with correlation tests and regression analysis.\n\nHypothesis #1\nHypothesis #1 states that where gender exclusion is low and political inclusion of women is high, health outcomes are better and maternal mortality is low. This will hold true even when controlling for variables which are known to have an effect on both women’s political inclusion and maternal mortality.\nHow does the explanatory variable (GenderExclusion) relate to the dependent variable (Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017)?\nA correlation test shows that the explanatory variable (GenderExclusion) and the dependent variable (Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017) have a moderate positive correlation. The p-value here is small and indicates this relationship is statistically significant.\n\n\nCode\ncor.test(MMR_Analysis$Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017, MMR_Analysis$GenderExclusion)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  MMR_Analysis$Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 and MMR_Analysis$GenderExclusion\nt = 5.6182, df = 153, p-value = 8.877e-08\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.2737461 0.5362357\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.4135474 \n\n\nAs noted above, the Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 has a right-skewed distribution, so a logged version of the variable should be considered. This is also the case for the GenderExclusion variable. Different combinations of logged versions of these variables will be compared here.\n\n\nCode\nMMR_Analysis &lt;- mutate(MMR_Analysis, \"logMMR2017\" = log(Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017))\nMMR_Analysis &lt;- mutate(MMR_Analysis, \"logGenderExclusion\" = log(GenderExclusion))\n\ncor.test(MMR_Analysis$logMMR2017, MMR_Analysis$GenderExclusion)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  MMR_Analysis$logMMR2017 and MMR_Analysis$GenderExclusion\nt = 7.8117, df = 153, p-value = 8.383e-13\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.4109084 0.6379160\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.5339668 \n\n\nCode\ncor.test(MMR_Analysis$logMMR2017, MMR_Analysis$logGenderExclusion)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  MMR_Analysis$logMMR2017 and MMR_Analysis$logGenderExclusion\nt = 10.12, df = 153, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.5282982 0.7190763\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.6332094 \n\n\nCode\ncor.test(MMR_Analysis$Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017, MMR_Analysis$logGenderExclusion)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  MMR_Analysis$Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 and MMR_Analysis$logGenderExclusion\nt = 5.8772, df = 153, p-value = 2.52e-08\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.2912203 0.5496274\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.4291654 \n\n\nA comparison of these correlation tests shows that the highest correlation is with the logged versions of the variables, logGenderExclusion and logMMR2017. These variables should be compared in the linear regression analysis as well.\nA linear regression analysis also shows a significant relationship between the explanatory variable (GenderExclusion) and the dependent variable (Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017) and the logged versions.\n\n\nCode\n# Model with only the explanatory variable and the dependent variable\nMMR_nolog &lt;- (lm(formula = Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 ~ GenderExclusion,\n                              data = MMR_Analysis))\n\nGElog &lt;- (lm(formula = Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017 ~ logGenderExclusion,\n                              data = MMR_Analysis))\n\nMMRlog &lt;- (lm(formula = logMMR2017 ~ GenderExclusion,\n                              data = MMR_Analysis))\n\nAllLog &lt;- (lm(formula = logMMR2017 ~ logGenderExclusion,\n                              data = MMR_Analysis))\n\nstargazer(MMR_nolog, GElog, MMRlog, AllLog, type = 'text') \n\n\n\n==================================================================================\n                                               Dependent variable:                \n                               ---------------------------------------------------\n                               Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017       logMMR2017     \n                                     (1)            (2)          (3)       (4)    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGenderExclusion                  414.685***                   3.789***            \n                                  (73.811)                     (0.485)            \n                                                                                  \nlogGenderExclusion                               106.717***              1.114*** \n                                                  (18.158)               (0.110)  \n                                                                                  \nConstant                           32.225        327.106***   2.725***   5.616*** \n                                  (31.274)        (31.057)     (0.206)   (0.188)  \n                                                                                  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nObservations                         155            155          155       155    \nR2                                  0.171          0.184        0.285     0.401   \nAdjusted R2                         0.166          0.179        0.280     0.397   \nResidual Std.

The interaction term was also not significant, indicating that we do not need to keep it. The model without the interaction term or the Expend_Health_pct_GDP variable has the lowest R^2 value, although that may be because it has fewer variables than the other two models.

This hypothesis proposes that the empowerment and political inclusion of women in a country has a positive effect on the maternal health infrastructure and specifically on the presence of skilled attendants at birth, which in turn has the effect of reducing maternal mortality. As discussed in the introduction, previous research has identified the presence of a skilled attendant at birth as a factor that reduces the incidence of maternal mortality.27 28 This research question seeks to determine whether the presence of a skilled birth attendant acts as a mediator between the explanatory variable and the dependent variable in this analysis.\nThe process of mediation analysis involves identifying a model that shows the total effect (the effect of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable without the presence of the mediator variable), and two models that show indirect effect (the effect between the explanatory variable and the mediator, and the mediator and the dependent variable while controlling for the explanatory variable). Following that, these models are processed through the mediate() function, which estimates the mediation relationship.\n\n\nCode\n# Total effect model (effect of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable without the presence of the mediator variable).

This was not found to be significant.\nADE (average direct effects) shows the direct effect of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable. This was also calculated in the second indirect effect model above. In both cases the relationship between the explanatory variable and the dependent variable was found to be significant at the 0.001 (.1%) level.\nThe Total Effect reports the sum of the direct and indirect effects of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable. This was also found in the first step of this process when the total effect was calculated. In both cases, the effect of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable was found to be significant at the 0.001 (.1%) level.\nFinally, Prop. Mediated indicates the proportion of the effect of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable that goes through the mediator. The ACME has already shown that the explanatory variable’s effect on the dependent variable does not go through the mediator, so this is also not significant.\nIn sum, this model shows that while gender exclusion has a direct effect on maternal mortality, there is no statistically significant evidence that this effect is mediated via the presence of skilled birth attendants."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis analysis supports the first hypothesis, that where gender exclusion is low and political inclusion of women is high, maternal mortality is also lower. This held true even when controlling for democracy, GDP, and the presence of skilled birth attendants.\nThis analysis did not, however, support the hypothesis that the effect of political inclusion of women on maternal mortality was mediated by the presence of skilled attendants at birth. In fact, this research found that women’s political inclusion did not have a significant effect on the presence of skilled birth attendants. This suggests that the way in which women’s political inclusion and empowerment impacts maternal mortality is through another mechanism that was not explored in this analysis."

The null hypothesis of this test is homoskedasticity and the high p-value here means we cannot fully reject the null.

So the SkilledBirthAtt variable will remain unchanged.↩︎\nBetrán, A.P., Wojdyla, D., Posner, S.F. et al. National estimates for maternal mortality: an analysis based on the WHO systematic review of maternal mortality and morbidity.
