### My Approach

My background in the humanities and qualitative research methods makes me a uniquely critical and nuanced data analyst. I love data analysis and quantitative research because it uncovers patterns and insights that might otherwise go unnoticed. It’s incredibly fulfilling to see how data can complement storytelling, challenge assumptions, and inform meaningful policy and decision-making. 

Combining the richness of qualitative approaches with the precision of quantitative tools allows me to explore complex social phenomena more holistically. I prioritize interpreting findings within the proper context and understanding the limitations of quantitative data, viewing these as equally essential to the analytical process as using statistical methods to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships.

### Education and Work Experience

-   BA in Foreign Area Studies with a concentration in French History from **Barnard College at Columbia University** in New York City.

-   MSc in European Studies from the **London School of Economics**, with a focus on immigration policy.

-   Advanced Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science from the **University of Massachusetts Amherst**.
