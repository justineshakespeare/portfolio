### My Approach

I'm passionate about how data analysis and quantitative research reveal insights that might otherwise go unnoticed. It's incredibly fulfilling to see data complement storytelling, challenge assumptions, and drive meaningful policy and decision-making.

With a background in the humanities and qualitative research methods, I bring a nuanced and thoughtful approach to data analysis. I prioritize interpreting findings within the proper context and collaborating with subject matter experts to ensure alignment with real-world insights and account for any data gaps. To me, this is just as essential as applying statistical methods to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships.

### Education and Work Experience

-   BA in Foreign Area Studies with a concentration in French History from **Barnard College at Columbia University** in New York City. Graduated *magna cum laude* with department honors.

-   MSc in European Studies from the **London School of Economics**, with a focus on immigration policy.

-   Advanced Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science from the **University of Massachusetts Amherst**. GPA: 4.0

-   Close to a decade of experience working for the international NGO [Verit√©](http://verite.org), specializing in leading research projects on forced labor, human trafficking, and the working conditions of migrant workers in global supply chains.
