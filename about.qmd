### About Me

Outside of work, I enjoy crossword puzzles, exploring local bike trails, skiing and [ceramics](https://www.instagram.com/justineshakespeareceramics?igsh=MW9xYmwzaXlyeGhrbA%3D%3D&utm_source=qr). After spending over a decade in New York City, I now split my time between Western Massachusetts and the metropolitan area.

### Education and Work Experience

-   BA in Foreign Area Studies with a concentration in French History from **Barnard College at Columbia University** in New York City. Graduated *magna cum laude* with department honors.

-   MSc in European Studies from the **London School of Economics**, with a focus on immigration policy.

-   Advanced Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science from the **University of Massachusetts Amherst**. GPA: 4.0

-   Close to a decade of experience working for the international NGO [Verit√©](http://verite.org), specializing in leading research projects on forced labor, human trafficking, and the working conditions of migrant workers in global supply chains.
