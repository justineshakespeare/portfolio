I’m Justine Shakespeare, a seasoned professional with over a decade of experience in research and project management. Having previously earned my BA at Barnard College and my MSc at the London School of Economics, I recently completed an advanced graduate certificate in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In this program I enhanced my technical skills in data analytics, quantitative analysis, research design, and survey methodology. 

Explore the [Projects](https://justineshakespeare.github.io/portfolio/Projects.html) page for featured coursework and other data analysis highlights. The [Professional Work](https://justineshakespeare.github.io/portfolio/ProfessionalWork.html) page includes a curated selection of my work at the international labor rights NGO [Verité](http://verite.org).
