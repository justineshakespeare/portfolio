I'm Justine Shakespeare, a seasoned professional with over a decade of experience in research and project management. Recently, I completed an advanced graduate certificate in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In this program I enhanced my technical skills in data analytics, quantitative analysis, research design, and survey methodology. Explore the [Projects](https://jns2589.github.io/jshakespeare/Projects.html) page for featured coursework and other data analysis highlights. The [Professional Work](https://jns2589.github.io/jshakespeare/ProfessionalWork.html) page includes a curated selection of my work at the international labor rights NGO [Verité](http://verite.org).

With a strong foundation in project management and research design, coupled with my newfound proficiency in data analytics, I'm eager to integrate my diverse skill set to drive impactful outcomes.
