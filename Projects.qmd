As a graduate student in the Data Analytics and Computational Social Science (DACSS) program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, I have taken the following graduate-level courses: Data Science Fundamentals, Intro to Quantitative Analysis, Research Design, Survey Research Methods, and Text as Data. The final projects for several of these courses are featured below.

I have also attended several methodology workshops hosted by the Institute for Social Science Research at UMass Amherst. I've included below some of the projects that came out of those workshops.
